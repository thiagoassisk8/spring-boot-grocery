## Business Logic Explanation

The application's business logic ensures a comprehensive solution meeting requirements:

1. Utilizing WireMock, the application seamlessly integrates data retrieval for the payment system, ensuring smooth usability.
2. The payment system intelligently applies discounts based on specified parameters, ensuring customers benefit from available deals. Cupoms are only applied if the requirements match, ensuring fairness and consistency.
3. Enhancing customer experience, the system displays the amount saved through applied discounts.

The entire business logic relies on the `/products/addCart` endpoint because it follows these key rules required:

1. Items can be added in any order.
2. Discounts should be used whenever they're applicable.
3. The store owner wants to show how much money the customer is saving.
